# ConsoleClock
A simple digital clock writen in c# as a console application.

The size as well as the digits are fully customizable as long as it is a 5x5 pixel image.

The convert-time function converts a string that contains numbers and a semi-colon, to a readable format for the draw function.

The draw function can draw as many of the predefined clusters next to each other as you want as well as all the digits and semi-colons of course.
For a new line you need to call the draw function again to "draw" in a new Line.

Example:
